The resource you used to learn Python will typically have some sort of exercises, so those would be ideal as a first choice. I'd also suggest using the below resources to improve your skills. If you get stuck, reread the material related to those topics, search online, ask for clarifications, etc — in short, make an effort to solve it. It is okay to skip some troublesome problems (and come back to it later if you have the time), but you should be able to solve most of the beginner problems. Maintaining notes and cheatsheets will help too, especially for common mistakes.<ul><li><a href=https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises>Exercism</a>, <a href=https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/>Hackinscience</a> and <a href=https://www.practicepython.org/>Practicepython</a> — these are all beginner friendly and difficulty levels are marked<li><a href=https://github.com/learnbyexample/100_page_python_intro/blob/main/exercises/Exercises.md>100 Page Python Intro exercises</a> — practice problems from my introductory guide<li><a href=https://adventofcode.com/>Adventofcode</a>, <a href=https://www.codewars.com/>Codewars</a>, <a href=https://www.pythonmorsels.com/>Python Morsels</a> — includes more challenging exercises for intermediate to advanced level users<li><a href=https://py.checkio.org/>Checkio</a>, <a href=https://www.codingame.com/start>Codingame</a>, <a href=https://codecombat.com/>Codecombat</a> — gaming based challenges<li><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer>/r/dailyprogrammer</a> — not active currently, but there's plenty of past challenges with discussions</ul><p>Once you are comfortable with basics and syntax, the next step is projects. I wrote a 10-line program that solved a common problem for me — adding <code>body { text-align: justify }</code> to <code>epub</code> files that are not justify aligned. I didn't know that this line would help beforehand. Found a solution online and then automated the process of unzipping <code>epub</code>, adding the line and then packing it again. That will likely need you to lookup documentation and go through some stackoverflow Q&A as well. And once you have written the solution and use it regularly, you'll likely encounter corner cases and features to be added. I feel this is a great way to learn and understand programming.<p>These days, I use a better EPUB reader that allows me to customize alignments. Here's another real world example. I'm on Linux and use the terminal for many things. I wanted a CLI tool to do simple calculations. There's <code>bc</code> command, but it doesn't accept direct string argument and you need to set <code>scale</code> and so on. So, I looked up how to write a CLI tool in Python and <a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/practice_python_projects/calculator/calculator.html>wrote one using the built-in <code>argparse</code> module</a> that works for my particular use cases.<p>Here are some resources to help you get started on projects:<ul><li><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/practice_python_projects/>Practice Python Projects</a> — my book on beginner to intermediate level projects<li><a href=https://github.com/karan/Projects-Solutions>Projects with solutions</a> — algorithms, data structures, networking, security, databases, etc<li><a href=https://github.com/practical-tutorials/project-based-learning#python>Project based learning</a> — web applications, bots, data science, machine learning, etc<li><a href=https://github.com/norvig/pytudes>Pytudes by Peter Norvig</a> — Python programs, usually short, of considerable difficulty<li>Books: <ul><li><a href=https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/>The Big Book of Small Python Projects</a><li><a href=https://www.manning.com/books/tiny-python-projects>Tiny Python Projects</a><li><a href=https://practicalpython.yasoob.me/toc.html>Practical Python Projects</a><li><a href=https://nostarch.com/impracticalpythonprojects>Impractical Python Projects</a> and <a href=https://nostarch.com/real-world-python>Real world Python</a></ul><li><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/k5k1h0/what_do_you_automate_with_python_at_home/>/r/learnpython: What do you automate with Python at home?</a></ul><p><img alt=info src=/images/info.svg> See also <a href=https://goodresearch.dev/>The Good Research Code Handbook</a> to learn how to organize your code so that it is easy to understand and works reliably.</p><br><h2 id=debugging>Debugging<a aria-label="Anchor link for: debugging" class=zola-anchor href=#debugging>🔗</a></h2><p>Knowing how to debug your programs is crucial and should be ideally taught right from the beginning instead of a chapter at the end of the book. <a href=https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/>Think Python</a> is an awesome example for such a resource material.<p>Sites like <a href="https://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit">Pythontutor</a> allow you to visually debug a program — you can execute a program step by step and see the current value of variables. Similar feature is typically provided by IDEs like <a href=https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>Pycharm</a> and <a href=https://thonny.org/>Thonny</a>. Under the hood, these visualizations are using the <a href=https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html>pdb module</a>. See also <a href=https://realpython.com/python-debugging-pdb/>Python debugging with pdb</a>.<p>Debugging is often a frustrating experience. Taking a break helps (and sometimes I find the solution or spot a problem in my dreams). Try to reduce the code as much as possible so that you are left with minimal code necessary to reproduce the issue. Talking about the problem to a friend/colleague/inanimate-objects/etc can help too — known as <a href=https://rubberduckdebugging.com/>Rubber duck debugging</a>. I have often found the issue while formulating a question to be asked on forums like stackoverflow/reddit because writing down your problem is another way to bring clarity than just having a vague idea in your mind. Here's some more articles on this challenging topic:<ul><li><a href=https://jvns.ca/blog/2019/06/23/a-few-debugging-resources/>What does debugging a program look like?</a><li><a href=https://thepythoncodingbook.com/2022/04/17/debugging-python-code-is-like-detective-work-lets-investigate/>Debugging Python code is like detective work</a><li><a href=https://ericlippert.com/2014/03/05/how-to-debug-small-programs/>How to debug small programs</a><li><a href=https://uchicago-cs.github.io/debugging-guide/>Debugging guide</a><li><a href=https://ryanstutorials.net/problem-solving-skills/>Problem solving skills</a></ul><p>Here's an interesting snippet (paraphrased) from a collection of <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/q/169713/4082052>interesting bug stories</a>.<blockquote><p>A jpeg parser choked whenever the CEO came into the room, because he always had a shirt with a square pattern on it, which triggered some special case of contrast and block boundary algorithms.</blockquote><p><img alt=info src=/images/info.svg> See also <a href=https://500mile.email/>this curated list of absurd software bug stories</a>.</p><br><h2 id=testing>Testing<a aria-label="Anchor link for: testing" class=zola-anchor href=#testing>🔗</a></h2><p>Another crucial aspect in the programming journey is knowing how to write tests. In bigger projects, usually there are separate engineers (often in much larger number than code developers) to test the code. Even in those cases, writing a few sanity test cases yourself can help you develop faster knowing that the changes aren't breaking basic functionality.<p>There's no single consensus on test methodologies. There is <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing>Unit testing</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing>Integration testing</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development>Test-driven development</a> and so on. Often, a combination of these is used. These days, machine learning is also being considered to reduce the testing time, see <a href=https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/07/testing-firefox-more-efficiently-with-machine-learning/>Testing Firefox more efficiently with machine learning</a> for example.<p>When I start a project, I usually try to write the programs incrementally. Say I need to iterate over files from a directory. I will make sure that portion is working (usually with <code>print</code> statements), then add another feature — say file reading and test that and so on. This reduces the burden of testing a large program at once at the end. And depending upon the nature of the program, I'll add a few sanity tests at the end. For example, for my <a href=https://github.com/learnbyexample/command_help>command_help</a> project, I copy pasted a few test runs of the program with different options and arguments into a separate file and wrote a program to perform these tests programmatically whenever the source code is modified.<p>For non-trivial projects, you'll usually end up needing frameworks like built-in module <code>unittest</code> or third-party modules like <code>pytest</code>.
